            XXX: blackbean123: my understanding of why we can use Dijkstra here:
            1. here, the total path cost is the maximum absolute difference, its a different kind of cost function
                compared to the vanilla adding all costs together along the path
            2. for Dijkstra, edge weight cannot be negative, but what does that really mean. It effectively means
                total path cost cannot go down when a new edge joins the path. In the vanilla Dijkstra, it's in the
                form of negative edge weight. If we translate that to this problem, we can see that the total path
                cost (maximum absolute difference) will never go down when a new edge joins the path
