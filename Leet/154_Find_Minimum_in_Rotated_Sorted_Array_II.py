Leetcode Explore: Binary Search - Conclusion

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
