Leetcode Explore Graph: DFS

XXX: OS: For cycle detection, We will be following the node-coloring variant of the
algorithm which is explained in the Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) book.
OS explain is succinct in visualization: [why visited won't detect cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-lead-to-destination/Figures/1059/img1.png)
