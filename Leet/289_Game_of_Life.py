âœ… GOOD Matrix (state: from 1bit => 2bit)
tag: Medium, Matrix
Lookback:
- Pochmann: state is bool, so we use 2-bit [new state, old state] to represent, so we can do the regular count, while get new state. And easy to get back to bool state in final result
- OS: Trick: define dummy state, so as to in-place next state. Then another O(N) to get real next state
- reminds #41.
