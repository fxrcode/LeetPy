Leetcode Explore Graph: Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
You are given a string s, and an array of pairs of indices in the string pairs where pairs[i] = [a, b] indicates 2 indices(0-indexed) of the string.

You can swap the characters at any pair of indices in the given pairs any number of times.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that s can be changed to after using the swaps.
tag: medium, Union-Find
Lookback:
- logic thinking can give 1-second proof that "equal" chars can be sort! 
    * instinct logic as in 1443. Minimum walk = 2*(n-1)

        XXX: I got the blurred lemma that same group and exchange any 2. But not sure how to prove so as to use. Then I think about sort each group.
            Actually very intuitive. It's just like I want to swap things in diner with families. By swapping, any two of us can swap.
        XXX: Last step to sort group than similar to merge sort idea is cool.
