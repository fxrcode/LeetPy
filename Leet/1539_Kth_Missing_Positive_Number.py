            We need a way to check on how many positive integers are missing before the given array element to use binary search. To do that, let's compare the input array [2, 3, 4, 7, 11] with an array with no missing integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The number of missing integers is a simple difference between the corresponding elements of these two arrays:
            * arr=[2,3,4,7,11], origin=[1,2,3,4,5]
                Before 2, there is 2 - 1 = 1 missing integer.
                Before 3, there is 3 - 2 = 1 missing integer.
                Before 4, there is 4 - 3 = 1 missing integer.
                Before 7, there are 7 - 4 = 3 missing integers.
                Before 11, there are 11 - 5 = 6 missing integers.

            why l+k: We use binary search to find the smallest index, l, such that there are more than k missing numbers in [0, A[l]].
            The actual number of missing numbers in [0, A[l-1]] is A[l-1] - (l - 1) - 1 = A[l-1] - l.
            Counting from A[l-1], The k-th missing number is therefore A[l-1] + k - (A[l-1] - l) = l + k

            XXX: careful on l,r!!! they're defined by problem's specific search space! You need to fully check problem so as to get l,r right!
