âœ… GOOD BFS

Leetcode explore Queue & Stack: Conclusion
Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

XXX: tip 1: Q: how to calculate the distance of 2 cells? Ans: abs(r1-r2) + abs(c1-c2)
XXX: tip 2: Q: how to use BFS to calculate sssp from 1 to 0? Ans: rather bfs from 1 to reach 0 which make lavel 1's step = 0, then 1.
            We can reverse the bfs's source/destination by bfs from 0 to 1, then level 1 = 0, level 2 = 1!
