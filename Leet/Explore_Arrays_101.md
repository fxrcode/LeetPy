## Introduction

- Arrays can be used to solve many interesting problems. Arrays come up very often in interview problems, and so being a guru with them is a must!

## Inserting Items into an Array

## Deleting Items from an Array

- Crux is loop invariant for any looping.

## Searching for Items in an Array (2 problems)

- 2 types of search:
  a. linear search
  b. binary search when sorted ar

## In-place Operations (5 problems)

- Interviewers often expects you to minimize time/space complexity of your implementation.
  - In-place operation helps to reduce space complexity. So it's regularly required in interview
- Remove Duplicates from sorted array
  - Use 2-pointers technique, and similar to Lomuto partition pattern: loop invariant.
