Weekly Special (Nov 15)
Day 15
NOTE:
# two insights
* 1. Longest path in a tree can only happen between two leaves nodes or between a leaf node and the root node.
* 2. Each non-leaf node acts as a bridge for the paths between its descendant leaves nodes.
    * If we pick two longest sub-paths from a non-leaf node to its descendant leavest nodes, and combine them together,
    then the resulting path would be the longest path among all possible ones that are bridged by this non-leaf node.

# Algs
* Diameter: longest path between any two nodes in the N-ary tree.
* 1st glance: we might have to enumerate all pairs of nodes, in order to find out the longest path.
* With above 2 insights, it suffices to enumerate all non-leaf nodes and select the top-2 longest sub-paths bridged by each non-leaf node.

# two properties of Tree (both count #edges, but one goes down (and pick the largest), other goes up (single src/dest))
* `height` of a node: length of the longest downward path to a leaf node from that node.
* `depth` of a node: length of the path to the ROOT node.

# Two approaches
* 1. Distance with Height
* 2. Distance with Depth
