Study Plan: Dynamic Programming
Day 15: Memoization

tag: medium, DP, dfs (memo)
Lookback:
- Impl dfs w/ immutable state + return, so as to @cache. Don't use 9chap backtrack template, it's not Good for @cache.

        Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 65.14% of Python3 online submissions for Word Break.

        XXX: OS: wordbreak is like puzzle game. Analogy: puzzle <-> complete word, pieces <-> word dict.
        Top-down: When you start from complete puzzle and remove one valid piece at a time, until we reach empty.
            - why recursion, cuz we're asking the same question on smaller & smaller versions of given substring.
        Bottom-up: When we go from empty and use puzzle pieces to build up the final puzzle.

        T: as explained in 9chap, a word can be partitioned in n+1 slots, each slot can be cut or not cut, so O(2^n)

        TODO:dp. For dp problems, many times we go into iterative dp directly without even thinking about dfs. This is a great example showing that dfs is better than dp.
        DFS returns as soon as it finds one way to break the word while dp computes if each substring starting/ending at i is breakable.
        The test cases of this problem do not show it but it is shown in a similar problem Concatenated Words.
