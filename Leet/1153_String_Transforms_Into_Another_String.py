            https://leetcode.com/problems/string-transforms-into-another-string/discuss/553209/Solution-with-a-narrative-of-how-you-might-derive-this-yourself-in-real-life

            let's continue testing the hypothesis on the particular predicates:
            we introduce a cycle to the valid case above to consider the cycle predicate of our hypothesis
            i.e. aabcc -> ccdaa (has cycle a->c->a)
            #                c -> z       a -> c      b -> d       z -> a
            # a a b c c -> a a b z z -> c c b z z -> c c d z z -> c c d a a
            # c c d a a

            hence, **cycles** are fine as long as there are characters available to use as temporary variables
            Now we can propose a theorem
            Theorem: transformation is possible iff:
               * character edges form a linear directed graph (no forks)
               * there are characters in the lexicon not accounted for in the strings that can be used as temporary variables
