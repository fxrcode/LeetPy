âœ… GOOD DP (1D definition)
Tag: Medium, DP
Lookback:
- Study Plan: Dynamic Programming
- 1st. notice the different of DP table definition compare to regular 1D DP (in common 1D DP, T[i] must ends with nums[i])
        max up wiggle (end of up) using first i-elements, end at a certain position (no neccesory nums[i])!!!
- 2nd. when you can't extend the length, you inherit from up[i-1]
