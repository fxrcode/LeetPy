        XXX: Huahua's analysis is so GOOOD. For tree, 90% recursion. Two crux for Tree recursion analysis:
        1. analyze to pick the right order: pre/in/post recursion?
        2. local view analysis

        Notes:
        * just need to draw 3 level of tree to analyze.
        * We check subtree a for local view. easily we can connect b->c. But how to connect c->e? we need to get d from a.
        * since we analyzed b->c is connected via rec(a), so a->d is done by rec(p). 
        * Therefore We need to do rec(p) before rec(a), so it's preorder rather inorder.
