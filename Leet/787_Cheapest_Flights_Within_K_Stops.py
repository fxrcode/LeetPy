        bwv988: Some explanation.
        Because there could be routes which their length is shorter but pass more stops, and those routes don't
        necessarily constitute the best route in the end. To deal with this, rather than maintain the optimal
        routes with 0..K stops for each node, the solution simply put all possible routes into the priority queue,
        so that all of them has a chance to be processed. IMO, this is the most brilliant part.
