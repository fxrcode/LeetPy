            XXX: We aim to apply DP, so we are looking for an order that suitable for DP.
            Q: Can we move robot1 to the bottom firstly, then move robot2? NO
            A: Maybe not. In this case, the movement of robot1 will impact the movement of robot2.
                In other words, the optimal track of robot2 depends on the track of robot1. If we want
                to apply DP, we need to record the whole track of robot1 as the state.
                The number of sub-problems is too much.
