            1) Check value node.val and if it is in our range, add it to global sum.
            2) We need to visit left subtree only if node.val > low, that is if node.val < low,
                it means, that all nodes in left subtree less than node.val, that is less than low as well.
            3) Similarly, we visit right subtree only if node.val < high.
