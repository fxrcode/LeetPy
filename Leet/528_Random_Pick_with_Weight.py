XXX: This is actually a very practical problem which appears often in the scenario
    where we need to do sampling over a set of data.

Nowadays, people talk a lot about machine learning algorithms.
    As many would reckon, one of the basic operations involved in training a machine learning algorithm (e.g. Decision Tree)
    is to sample a batch of data and feed them into the model, rather than taking the entire data set.
