Leetcode Explore Graph: Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.
Return the number of connected components in the graph.

            XXX: Nice solution. One remark is that this Union-Find algorithm uses Union by rank, otherwise the time complexity is O(log(N)) for each merge.
            Only with both Union by rank and path compression, we have ~O(1) time for each union/find operation, so it gives O(V + E) time in total.
