âœ… GOOD DP (re-state, discretize)
Daily challenge (Mar 5, 2022)

Study Plan: Dynamic Programming

tag: medium, DP
Lookback:
- reduce problem by re-state, then it becomes disguise 198. House Robber (knapsack state vs choice)!
- how to find this reduction? The problem is relate to nums[i] +/- 1, rather given nums' order!
- similar reduction found in medium/hard problem
    - 1035. Uncrossed line (disguise LCS)
    - 296. Best meeting point (from 1D median [2033])
    - 1901. Find a peak Element II (from 1D peak [162])
- 1st time Discretize
