Comparison: Dijkstra vs Bellman-ford vs Floyd
- Good:
* CP4's Dijkstra support negative edge because each node into PQ not only once. So better than Bellman.
* But Bellman can find negative cycle.
* Floyd is All path SP.
- Bad:
All fail if negative cycle!

- Tip
* represent Graph
    * Simple graph (unit weight, or no weight, use AL = {u:v})
    * Weighted graph (use AL = {u: {v:w}}, so AL = defaultdict(dict), then you for v in AL[u], and w = AL[u][v])
* as CP4 said:
    * unweighted graph, use BFS for shortest path, since BFS is linear!
    * if weighted, use CP4's Dijkstra. Since most case, no negative cycle!
* If you need to reconstruct shortest path
    * simply record pre[u]
    
- How
If SSSP given negative cycle, you can only use backtrack
