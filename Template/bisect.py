        [Python] Powerful Ultimate Binary Search Template. Solved many problems
        https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/786126/Python-Powerful-Ultimate-Binary-Search-Template.-Solved-many-problems
        Only 3 parts to change to apply this template:

        1) Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to include all possible elements;
        2) Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1?
            !Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function;
        3) Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.

        For the interval notation, Professor E.W. Dijkstra favors left closed right open interval notation and explained why we benefit from this notation in his post which was published in 1982.
